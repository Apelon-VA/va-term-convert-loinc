Steps to deploy new source content:

	1) Place the source files into the native-source folder
	2) Update the version number as appropriate in pom.xml
	3) Run a command like this to deploy - (maestro is a server name that must be defined with credentials in your maven configuration):
		mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=maestro::default::https://va.maestrodev.com/archiva/repository/data-files/
		
Note - new source content should not be checked into SVN.  When finished, simply empty the native-source folder.

This simply expects one file - the zip file of the tech preview (which contains an RF2 formatted release)

The zip file should _not_ be extracted.
